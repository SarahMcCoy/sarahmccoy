### Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Sarah! Welcome to my porfolio. A little bit about me. I have a B.S. in Business Marketing from Abilene Christian University and am currently enrolled in an M.S. Business Analytics program with the University of North Texas. I have been developing my technical skills to start a career in data science. I took a python for data science and machine learning course where I learned how to use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, Machine Learning, Tensorflow, and more! 

#### Fun Facts:

- 🎮 If I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me playing a video game. My favorite game of all time; is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I’m looking forward to The Legend of Zelda: Tear of the Kingdom will release later this year.
