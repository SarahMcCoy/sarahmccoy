### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sarah! I have a B.S. in Business Marketing from Abilene Christian University and am currently enrolled in an M.S. Business Analytics program with the University of North Texas. I have been developing my technical skills to start a career in data science. I took a python for data science and machine learning course where I learned how to use NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, Machine Learning, Tensorflow, and more! 

Fun Facts:
The first language I used to program was "hello world" python 
I geek out about all things chess 
When I am not programming or studying, you can find me scrolling through Goodreads to find my next favorite book
